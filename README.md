This repository contains the files corresponding to the mathematical model presented in the article titled "Enhanced-Beacons Dynamic Transmission over TSCH" submitted for publication in the Future Internet magazine. https://www.mdpi.com/journal/futureinternet
The code was created in MatLab R2021a

The content of each folder is described below:
* Superface: Contains the code to create Figure 4
* Theo Expected: The function comp.m calculates the expected time for a node to get associate with the network following equation (6). Furthermore, it calculates this same value from equation (7). Obtaining the same result from both equations validates the mathematical development presented in Appendix A
* Theo Increase B: Contains the code used to obtain Figure 5
